Imagine Input n = 100,000

O(logN) will perform ~16 operations
O(N) will perform 100 k operations
O(NlogN) will perform 1600 k operations
O(N*N) will perform 100 B operations

Exponential complexity O(2^N)
2^100k is a 1 followed by approximately 30,100 zeros. For context, this number
is vastly larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe.
