Different strategies of searching are

1) Brute force - usually provides solution with maximum complexity and does not yield optimal solution
2) Sort and search. The searching could be linear or binary
3) Hashing technique - needs extra space for hash table
4) Clever method based on restrictions on the data
5) XOR data

Different specific types

1) Binary search tree
2) Patter searching algorithms for string
3) Trie

Union and Intersection
----------------------
1) Naive approach
2) Sort both arrays and iterate both
3) Sort smaller array and for every element of larger array, do binary search in smaller array
4) Use hash table
