Mean, Median and Mode are three kinds of averages. 

The mean is the average, where we add up all numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The median is the 
middle value in the list of numbers. To find the the median the numbers must be in the numerical order, so we may
need to rewrite the list of numbers. The mode is the value that occurs most often. If no number is repeated then 
there is no mode for the list.

The range is just the difference between the largest and smallest numbers of the list.

In short, 
Mean : regular meaning of "average"
Median : middle value (in a sorted list of numbers)
Mode : most often

If the given list has odd number of elements, then median is the middle number. If the list has even number of 
elements then median is the mean of the middle two values.

E.g.

for list 1, 2, 4, 7
Mean : (1 + 2 + 4 + 7) / 4 = 3.5
Median : (2 + 4) / 2 = 3
Mode : none

for list 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 12, 13
Mean : (8 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 12 + 13) / 9 = 95 / 9 = 10.56
Median : 11 (5th element in the list of 9 elements)
Mode : 11

Median = (total number of elements + 1) / 2   : for odd elements

Technically median denotes a value lying at the midpoint of a frequency distribution of observed values, such that
there is an equal probability of falling above or below it
